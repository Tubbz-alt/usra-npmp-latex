Recall rules for title: words that are always to be capitalized are
   placed in {Curly Braces} while other words should be capitalized
   as they would be printed for those journals that like capitalized
   titles; for other journals, like AGU, these words will be set in
   lower case.

These rules do not apply to BOOKTITLE, which is printed as is.

The first letter of a note text will also be set in lower case, unless
  placed in curly braces.

Can use {Curly Braces} over entire title or note for exact capitalization
   as shown below
