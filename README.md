#### Usage  

The main file for creating your proposal is `NPMP.tex`.  Auxiliary files are included for overall style and to create bibliographies.  Compile `NPMP.tex` with `pdflatex` to create your PDF file (required for submission).

#### Why use Git for manuscripts?
 -  Single files: using git simplifies things as there's only a single version of a manuscript.  
 -  Merging: if two people work on the same file at the same time, they can be merged without much issue.  
 -  Simplified "diff" documents: can also use latexdiff-vc (latexdiff with version control) to make pdf files similar to Word documents with "Track Changes".  
 -  Easier collaboration: No need to email files back and forth.
